  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>I'm a VFX Pipeline Software Supervisor and Lead Developer with extensive hands-on experience in Python, VFX and animation pipeline design, and team leadership.</p>
    <p>At Technicolor, I serve as the primary point of contact for pipeline-related requests across departments. I own all projects related to pipeline and asset management systems, providing critical support during high-impact issues while regularly identifying and resolving pipeline bottlenecks.</p>
    <p>I apply agile project management principles and break down complex technical challenges into manageable tasks. I collaborate with cross-functional teams to connect technical capabilities with artistic needs, developing production pipelines that effectively serve both requirements.</p>
